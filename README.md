# DAGV 1200 3D Modeling
hello world :)
Hi my name is Dialma Quiroz. I am currently in the 2D track for Animaiton & Game Development at Utah Valley University. Besides drawing and visual arts, I love to cook, discover new music, rewatch the same anime like 5 times, and be very active on campus (such as Honors Program, Social Impact Scholars, clubs, events, TRIO student, etc...). I love cel/traditionally animated media, and enjoy it when animated movies experiemnent with new styles (such as into the spider-verse movies). Another thing about me is that I like to explore a lot of unique and different topics, you can catch me lurking in the online space a lot (such as Discord or Instagram) and watching a lot of YouTube videos on niche topics.
